# Hi, I'm Yunusa Jibrin 👋

**ML Engineer building production-ready AI systems that solve real business problems**

📍 Newcastle upon Tyne, UK | 🇬🇧 Global Talent Visa Holder | 💼 Open to ML Engineering roles

---

## 🎯 What I Do

I build **production ML systems** from scratch—not tutorials, not demos—**deployable systems** that handle real-world edge cases, biased data, and out-of-distribution inputs.

**My approach:**
- ✅ Start with business problem, not model architecture
- ✅ Debug systematically (class collapse? overfitting? distribution shift?)
- ✅ Validate rigorously (test metrics ≠ production performance)
- ✅ Deploy honestly (document failures + lessons learned)

**Recent impact:**
- 📄 **95% time reduction** in contract review (2 hours → 6 minutes) with RAG system
- 🎯 **+38% accuracy improvement** in facial attribute prediction through systematic iteration
- 🛣️ **87% mAP detection** for road infrastructure monitoring (YOLOv8 + ONNX optimization)
- 🔍 **92% retrieval precision** in multi-document Q&A system

## 💡 What Makes My Work Different

Most ML portfolios show tutorial projects. Mine show **production engineering**:

| What Others Show | What I Show |
|------------------|-------------|
| "Built a chatbot" | "Built RAG system with 92% retrieval precision, fixed citation accuracy 72% → 94%" |
| "Trained YOLO model" | "Optimized YOLO (PyTorch → ONNX, 3x speedup), deployed on AWS ECS at $30/month" |
| "Achieved 85% accuracy" | "Achieved 85% accuracy, but real-world was 30%—here's why + root cause analysis" |
| "Used LangChain" | "Built multi-agent system, debugged class collapse (+221% F1), eliminated overfitting" |

**I document:**
- ✅ Trade-offs (speed vs accuracy, cost vs performance)
- ✅ Failed attempts (what didn't work + why)
- ✅ Systematic debugging (class collapse, overfitting, distribution shift)
- ✅ Business impact (95% time savings, $200K/year cost reduction)
- ✅ Production concerns (monitoring, bias detection, scalability)

## 💡 Philosophy

> **"Test accuracy is necessary but insufficient. I build systems that work in production, not just on test sets."**

I believe in:
- 🔍 Systematic debugging over random hyperparameter tuning
- 📊 Quantified impact over vague claims
- ⚠️ Honest evaluation over hiding failures
- 🚀 Production readiness over academic benchmarks
- 💼 Business value over technical complexity
